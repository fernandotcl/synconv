Introduction
============

synconv is a command line based audio format transcoder with an rsync-like
behavior. It's specially useful for synchronizing a music collection with
portable devices that either don't support some audio formats used in your
collection or that could benefit from smaller file sizes obtained with the
usage of a more lossy audio format.

synconv doesn't do the transcoding itself. Instead, it uses command line
decoders and encoders (such as lame[1]) to transcode the files. It creates
transcoding pipelines that are run in parallel, optimized for multicore
machines. Those pipelines are created in a way that should be familiar to
users of synchronization software such as rsync[2]. By default, if the
transcoded (or copied) file is already up-to-date, it isn't overwritten,
making it much easier to keep devices synchronized.

A brief list of features:

* Support for FLAC, Ogg Vorbis and MP3 codecs available (more to come)
* Parallel transcoding, optimized for multicore CPUs
* Audio tags are copied from the original file to the transcoded file
* Support for re-encoding files and skipping files that can't be transcoded
* Timestamps are checked to prevent duplicated work
* Renaming filters make it easy to work with filesystems such as FAT

Usage
=====

Use it as you would use rsync. By default, synconv will transcode to MP3 and
will only use a single thread:

$ synconv /music/Artist /media/phone/

See synconv(1) for more examples.


Future goals
============

For the short term, the plan is to let synconv stabilize. In the future, we
might want to have a more rich user interface showing more progress
information, but it's not a high priority item.

We could use more audio codecs, such as Apple's lossless codecs and Monkey's
Audio. Contributions are very welcome.


Reporting bugs
==============

Please use the GitHub issue tracker to post bug reports. If the issue hasn't
been reported yet and you have a patch, you might skip that step and send me
the patch directly and I'll apply it as soon as possible.


Contributing
============

Any help is appreciated, please feel free to contribute. I'll review your
patches and commit them if they are in accordance with this project's goals,
and you'll be credited for the changes (I may ask you to change a few things
things before your patches are accepted, though).

For the time being, send your patches to:

Fernando Tarlá Cardoso Lemos <fernandotcl AT gmail.com>

Please format your patches with "git format-patch" and then attach them to an
e-mail instead of sending the patches inlined in the message. This makes it
easier for me to apply them.

Another option is to fork the project on GitHub and send me pull requests.

If you want to implement a new feature, please ping me first so that we can
discuss it and also so that we don't end up implementing the same thing twice.
