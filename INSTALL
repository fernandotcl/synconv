Dependencies
============

Those are the dependencies needed to compile synconv:

* TagLib (libtag1-dev in Debian)
* Boost headers (libboost-dev in Debian)
* Boost filesystem (libboost-filesystem-dev in Debian)
* Boost thread (libboost-thread-dev in Debian)
* libpipeline (libpipeline-dev in Debian)
* pkg-config
* CMake

You probably want the encoders and decoders too. We currently support:

* flac (for FLAC encoding and decoding)
* lame (for MP3 encoding and decoding)
* oggenc (vorbis-tools in Debian, for Ogg Vorbis encoding)
* oggdec (vorbis-tools in Debian, for Ogg Vorbis decoding)

You don't need all of them, just the ones you will use.


Installation instructions
=========================

synconv uses CMake:

$ mkdir /path/to/build_dir
$ cd /path/to/build_dir
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install_dir /path/to/source_dir
$ make
$ make install
